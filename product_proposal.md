# AlgoBrute: Product Proposal & Go-to-Market Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary
**AlgoBrute** (formerly InsightTrader) is an algorithmic trading infrastructure designed for the **intermediate retail trader**. We bridge the gap between manual charting tools and complex institutional software.

**Mission**: To empower traders to automate their best ideas and sleep at night knowing their risk is managed.

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 The Problem
Intermediate traders are stuck. They have moved beyond "gambling" on Robinhood but find professional tools like Bloomberg or custom Python coding too expensive or time-consuming. They want to automate their strategies but lack the technical bridge to do so reliably.

### 2.2 Target Audience
*   **Persona**: "The Aspiring Systematizer"
*   **Demographics**: 25-45, likely has a day job, trades part-time.
*   **Psychographics**: Wants to remove emotion from trading. Values consistency over "moonshots."
*   **Pain Points**:
    *   "I can't watch the charts 24/7."
    *   "I panic sell/buy and ruin my strategy."
    *   "I don't have time to learn complex coding."

### 2.3 Competitive Landscape & Pricing Context
*   **TradingView**: ~$15-$60/mo. Great charts, poor automation.
*   **Composer.trade**: ~$24-$32/mo. Good no-code, but "black box" feel.
*   **TrendSpider**: ~$49-$100+/mo. Expensive for many.

**AlgoBrute Opportunity**: Offer a "Glass Box" solution (transparent logic) at a price point that feels like a no-brainer for someone already paying for data or newsletters.

## 4. Core Stories & Messaging

### Story 1: "From English to Execution"
*   **The Hook**: You don't need to be a Python wizard to build a bot.
*   **The Promise**: Describe your strategy in plain English ("Buy when RSI is below 30 and price is above the 200 SMA"). AlgoBrute converts it into a rigorous, testable strategy instantly.
*   **The Benefit**: Speed of iteration. Test 10 ideas in the time it used to take to code one.

### Story 2: "The Sleep-at-Night Guarantee"
*   **The Hook**: The biggest risk to your portfolio is *you*.
*   **The Promise**: Our hard-coded Risk Guardrails act as your external discipline officer. Max daily loss limits, position sizing rules, and volatility filters are enforced by the machine, not your willpower.
*   **The Benefit**: Emotional freedom. Let the bot handle the execution while you live your life.
