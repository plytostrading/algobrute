# Reference Assets

This folder contains static assets used in documentation (README) such as screenshots and demo GIFs.

## Replacing Placeholders
- Replace the SVG placeholders with real PNG/JPG/SVG screenshots or GIF recordings.
- Keep the same filenames if you want links in the main README to continue working.
- Recommended sizes:
  - Screenshots: 1400×900 (or any 16:10/16:9 aspect)
  - GIF demos: keep under 10–15 MB if possible

## Suggested Capture Points
- home-overview: Full UI with header, tabs (Chart/Intel/Strategy), and conversation panel
- chart-plotly: Candlestick + volume subplot with SMA overlays and signals (Plotly.js)
- chart-tradingview: Lightweight Charts with markers and indicators
- strategy-tree: Strategy Logic Tree with nodes and metrics
- conversation-reasoning: Conversation with “thinking process” expanded
- ai-conversation-demo: Short recording of user prompt to AI response with reasoning toggle
- backtesting-demo: Short recording of future backtesting flow (placeholder for now)
